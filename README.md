# Anime-Quick-Program
a program that matches selected characters with corresponding shows.
My simple first project created with Python. Gives a list of anime characters. Upon selecting one in the terminal, 
the anime corresponding with the character is displayed.
There are 5 characters that correspond with 4 different animes.
After five uses, the set limit is reached and the program will end.
